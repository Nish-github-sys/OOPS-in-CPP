# OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING IN CPP

Aim: To study and implement Classes and Objects.

Tools Used: VS Code or Programiz online compiler.

# Theory

**Object-Oriented Programming System (OOPS) in C++** is a way of writing programs using *objects*, which combine both data (variables) and functions (methods) into a single unit called a **class**.
It helps in organizing code in a logical and reusable manner.

The **main principles** of OOPS are:

1. **Encapsulation** – Binding data and related functions inside a class to protect and organize them.
2. **Abstraction** – Showing only the important details to the user while hiding the background logic.
3. **Inheritance** – Allowing one class to use properties and behaviors of another class, avoiding code duplication.
4. **Polymorphism** – Allowing the same function or operator to perform different tasks depending on the situation.

C++ supports OOPS through classes, objects, constructors, destructors, and function overloading.
This approach makes programs **modular, scalable, reusable, and easier to maintain** compared to procedural programming.
